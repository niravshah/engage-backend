                    The break provides children with the space to have fun and enjoy by taking part in
                    activities such as rock climbing, swimming, going to theme parks, cinema and
                    fun-filled. </p>
                <p> The encouragement, high level energy and one to one attention the children receive
                    from professional role models is invaluable for the children's self-esteem and
                    aspirations.

                Kids Adventure provides non-residential respite breaks for disadvantaged children aged 8-11 years.
                The program is run by teams of professional volunteers who provide desperately needed breaks
                for children and families within their local communities.
